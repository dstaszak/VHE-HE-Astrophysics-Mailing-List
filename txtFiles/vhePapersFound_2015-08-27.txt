* Title:  First Observation of Time Variation in the Solar-Disk Gamma-Ray
        Flux  with Fermi
* Authors: Kenny C. Y. Ng, John F. Beacom, Annika H. G. Peter, Carsten Rott
* Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, comments are welcome
* Abstract:
        "The solar disk is a bright gamma-ray source. Surprisingly, its
        flux is about one order of magnitude higher than predicted. As a
        first step toward understanding the physical origin of this
        discrepancy, we perform a new analysis in 1-100 GeV using 6 years
        of public Fermi-LAT data. Compared to the ..."

* Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures, To appear in Proceedings of the 34th
        International Cosmic Ray Conference
* Abstract:
        "The Crab Nebula is the brightest source in the very-high-energy
        (VHE) gamma-ray sky and one of the best studied non-thermal
        objects. The dominant VHE emission mechanism is believed to be
        inverse Compton scattering of low energy photons on relativistic
        electrons. While it is unclear how the electrons in the nebula ..."

* Abstract:
        "Cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CREs) at GeV-TeV energies are
        a unique probe of our local Galactic neighbourhood. CREs lose
        energy rapidly via inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron
        processes while propagating in the Galaxy, effectively placing a
        maximal propagation distance for TeV electrons of order ~1 kpc.
        Within this window, detected ..."
